      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">1. Overview</h3>
        <p>
          MAJAFAM (“we”, “us”, or “MAJAFAM”) provides a loyalty platform for YouTube communities (the “App”).
          This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, your rights, and the security measures we implement.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">2. Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>We only request minimal access via Google/YouTube necessary for the App functionality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google account information (read-only):</strong> public name and email address (if available from the requested scopes).</li>
          <li><strong>YouTube Channel ID (read-only):</strong> to verify channel ownership and match user activity with the loyalty program.</li>
          <li><strong>Activity data related to points:</strong> read-only activity data used to validate loyalty points (e.g., watch/interaction evidence) — only if the user grants the required scopes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>We do not request or collect passwords, private messages, or other sensitive data.</em></p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">3. Purpose of Data Use</h3>
        <p>We use the collected data solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verifying your YouTube Channel identity (Channel ID) so you can participate in the loyalty program.</li>
          <li>Recording and calculating loyalty points based on relevant activity.</li>
          <li>Delivering notifications about points, rewards, and support matters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>All access is <em>read-only</em></strong> — we do not modify your YouTube account content.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">4. Legal Basis & Consent</h3>
        <p>Data exchange is performed based on your consent when you sign in with Google and approve the requested scopes. You may revoke consent via your Google account settings at any time.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">5. Storage & Retention</h3>
        <p>We retain data necessary for service operation (e.g., Channel ID & points history) while your account is active or until you request deletion. Upon account deletion or data removal requests, we will delete data within a reasonable timeframe (max 30 business days), unless legal obligations require longer retention.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">6. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We <strong>do not sell</strong> user data. We may share limited data with third-party service providers that assist operations (e.g., hosting, analytics), strictly on a need-to-know basis and under confidentiality agreements. We will not share data for advertising purposes without your explicit consent.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">7. Security</h3>
        <p>We implement technical and organizational measures: encrypted connections (HTTPS), access restrictions, and industry practices to protect data. No system is 100% secure — in case of a security incident we will follow applicable regulations and notify affected users if required.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h3 class="h5">8. Cookies & Similar Technologies</h3>
        <p>We use cookies and local storage for site functionality (e.g., session management, UI preferences). You can disable cookies via your browser settings, but some App features may not function properly.</p>
